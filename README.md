# CS-320

Ensuring that my code, program, or software is functional and secure has been a key focus throughout this project. To achieve this, I implemented thorough unit testing using JUnit to verify that all methods behave as expected across a range of inputs. These tests included checks for invalid inputs and boundary conditions, which are essential for identifying potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring robust functionality. Additionally, I followed secure coding practices, such as validating user inputs, to prevent security risks like data breaches and injection attacks.

Interpreting user needs and translating them into functional software is essential for creating solutions that are both useful and user-friendly. In these projects, I started by analyzing the requirements and identifying the core functionality each service needed to provide, such as the ability to add, update, or delete contacts, tasks, and appointments. I then designed my code to meet these requirements directly and clearly, allowing for easy modifications based on feedback or evolving needs. By creating classes and methods that closely align with user requirements, I could ensure that my solution remained focused and addressed each specified need.

When approaching software design, I aimed for a modular structure that promotes maintainability and scalability. This involved breaking down complex functionality into smaller, manageable components and designing classes that are cohesive and loosely coupled. I leveraged object-oriented principles, like encapsulation and abstraction, to organize the code effectively and make it more readable and easier to test. This structured approach not only simplifies testing and debugging but also allows for future enhancements without major restructuring.
